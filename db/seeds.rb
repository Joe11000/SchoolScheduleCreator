# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# s = School.new(name: "School_A",
# 	             location: "43.5253 1253.5362",
# 	             bio: "Seeds...This is the Bio")
# s.password = "1234";
# s.password_confirmation = "1234"
# s.save

# t = Teacher.create(name: "Teacher_A",
# 	                 bio: "Seeds...I do teacherly things")

# cp = CoursesPool.create(subject:    "english",
# 	                      start_time: DateTime.now,
# 	                      end_time:   DateTime.now + 1.hour,
# 	                      min_students_to_teach: 2)
